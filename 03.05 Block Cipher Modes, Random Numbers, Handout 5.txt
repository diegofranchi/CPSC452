Block Cipher Modes of Operation

	Electronic Codebook Mode (ECB)
	
		The message is divided into blocks
		Plaintext is handled one block at a time and each block is encrypted using the same key
		
		Advantages:
			
			Each block is encrypted independently of the other blocks
			Ideal for short amount of data
			
		Disadvantages:
		
			For lengthy message, the ECB mode may not be secure
			If the same n-bit block of plaintext appears more than once in the message,
			it will always produce the same ciphertext - does not hide data patterns very well
			Weakness is due to the encrypted message blocks being independent
			
	Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
	
		The input to the encryption algorithm is the XOR of:
		the current plaintext block, and
		the preceeding ciphertext block
		
		Each ciphertext block is dependent on all plaintext blocks processed up to that point.
		
		Encryption: Cj = E(K, Cj-1 XOR Pj)
						 E(K, 0 XOR D (K, Cj))
						 E(K, D(K, Cj))
						 Cj
						 
		Decryption: Pj = Cj-1 XOR D(K, Cj)
					     Cj-1 XOR D(K, E(K, Cj-1 XOR Pj)) //encryption decryption cancel
						 Cj-1 XOR Cj-1 XOR Pj 
						 0 XOR Pj //Cj-1 XOR Cj-1 equals ZERO
						 Pj
						 
		Message Padding
		
			At end of message must handle a possible last block,
			which is not as large as block size of cipher 
			
		Advantages:
		
			Avalanche Effect - a ciphertext block depends on all blocks before it, and 
			any change to one block affects all the following ciphertext blocks
			
		Disadvantages:
		
				Encryption is squential (cannot be parallelized)
				Need Initialization Vector (IV)
					-which must be known by sender & reciever
					
	Cipher FeedBack Mode (CFB)

		C = takes ( E ( SR ) ) XOR P
		C XOR takes ( E ( SR ) )
		takes ( E ( SR ) ) XOR P XOR takes ( E ( SR ) )
		P
		
	Output FeedBack (OFB)
	
	Counter (CTR)

Mode							Description

Electronic Codebook (ECB)		Each block of plaintext bits is
								encoded independently using the
								same key

								rithm is the XOR of the next block
								of plaintext and the preceding block
								of ciphertext

Cipher Feedback (CFB)			Input is processed s bits at a time.
								Preceeding xiphertext is used as
								input.....

Linear Congruential Generator

	Common iterative technique using:
		Xn+1 = (aXn + c) mod m
		m: modulus
		0 < a < m: the multiplier
		0 <= c < m: the increment
		X0: the starting value/seed
		
			The selection of values for a,x
		
	Choose a large m: mearly equal to the maximum representable nonnegative integer fofr a given computer
	
Blum Blum Shub Generator

	X0 = s^2 mod n
	
	for i = 1 to oo
		Xi = (Xi-1)^2 mod n
		Bi = Xi mod 2
		
	Choose two large prime number p and q,
	that both have aremainder of 3 when divided by 4
	
	Choose random number s that is relatively prime to n = p*q
